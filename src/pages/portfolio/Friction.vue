                    Friction is a web broswer extension I am currently building that aims to
                    improve users productivity. In the financial world, we talk about friction when
                    we mean the efficiency of a transactions process. For example, Amazon's "One click to buy"
                    has very minimal friction. On the other hand, a website that requires 7 steps before
                    completing an order has a lot of friction.

                <p class="justify">
                    So the aim of this extension is to add friction between a user and a webiste he is trying to
                    avoid using because it hampers on his productivity. It goes against most website blockers who
                    literally prevents you from accessing a website.

                    The idea came to me when I tried to reduce my Facebook usage. I found that by signing out of my
                    account each time
                    I used it added friction when I tried to go back and check my Facebook feed. The time it took me
                    to
                    retrieve my password and login was enough for my brain to remind me that I wasn't supposed to be
                    there and so I went back to the task I was working on.
                    This is where the idea for friction was born!

                    Nowadays, building extensions for web broswsers is pretty simple. You can learn more about in
                    this very interesting article here:

                            click
                            me!
                        </a>
                    </span>
                    After deploying my extension to major browser, I would love to able to integrate with Apple's Screen time functionnality to add another way of restricting users access.
                </p>
                <p>I am currently using these tools to build out the extensions for the different browsers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>TypeScript</li>
                    <li>Vue Js</li>
                    <li>Git</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="stay-tuned">Stay tuned for updates !</p>
