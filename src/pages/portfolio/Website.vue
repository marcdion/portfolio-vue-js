                    I decided to add this to the list because, to be honest, I needed a sixth element in my
                    grid for simetry reasons, but also because I am proud of the finish product.

                    This website was built from scratch strictly using HTML and CSS. (Ok well I also used Bootstrap but let's keep it between you and me). I
                    wanted to show that it is possible to build something nice without using a bunch of bloated tools and frameworks. Don't get me wrong, I love
                    me some frameworks (Especially VueJs) but sometimes less is more. Remember kids, Keep it simple stupid ðŸ’‹
